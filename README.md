completed as a final project for ECE420, and as such much of the code was provided for us. The touch keyboard and controls are written in Java and can be found in /app/src/main/java/, while the cpp code performing the FM synthesis is in /app/src/main/cpp/, primarily in the header and source files for ece420_main.cpp and ADSR.cpp
