## TabletFM
# simple FM synthesizer application with touch keyboard designed for android tablet
completed as a final project for ECE420, and as such much of the code was provided for us. The touch keyboard and controls were written by my project partner and I in Java and can be found in /app/src/main/java/, while the cpp code performing the FM synthesis was written primarily by myself and is in /app/src/main/cpp/, in the header and source files for ece420_main.cpp and ADSR.cpp. Video demonstration with zero explanation or commentary can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlO69hmaHaY&t=84s)
